        <h1>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h1>
        <p>OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).</p>
        <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Classes:</strong> Blueprints for creating objects.</li>
            <li><strong>Objects:</strong> Instances of classes.</li>
            <li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> Mechanism to create a new class using properties and methods of an existing class.</li>
            <li><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within one unit.</li>
            <li><strong>Polymorphism:</strong> Ability to present the same interface for different underlying forms (data types).</li>
        </ul>
